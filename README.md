The software used to store, manage, query, and retrieve data stored in a relational database is called a relational database management system (RDBMS). The RDBMS provides an interface between users and applications and the database, as well as administrative functions for managing data storage, access, and performance.Reducing Data Redundancy. The file based data management systems contained multiple files that were stored in many different locations in a system or even across multiple systems. ...

Data Consistency.
Data sharing: The file system does not allow sharing of data or sharing is too complex. Whereas in DBMS, data can be shared easily due to a centralized system. Data concurrency: Concurrent access to data means more than one user is accessing the same data at the same timeReduced data redundancy. Consistency of data. Flexibility of the file system. Enhanced data sharing facilityRelational Database Management System: This type of database management system that stores the data in the form of related tables. It is a social database administrator which deals with some typical kind of queries and uses SQL for the development of the database.The key advantages of relational databases include the following:
Categorizing data. Database administrators can easily categorize and store data in a relational database that can then be queried and filtered to extract information for reports. ...

Security.Database Management System (DBMS) is defined as the software system that allows users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database. DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in database. It is a layer between programs and dataDBMS stands for Database Management System, and RDBMS is the acronym for the Relational Database Management system. In DBMS, the data is stored as a file, whereas in RDBMS, data is stored in the form of tables.Advantages of Database Management System
